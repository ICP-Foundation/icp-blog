Introduction to DFINITY and the Internet Computer

DFINITY is a not-for-profit foundation dedicated to developing and supporting the Internet Computer. The Internet Computer is extending the internet by providing new functionality to host software and services directly on the internet. The internet’s newfound ability to host software is made possible by a network of independent data centers around the world running an open protocol called ICP (Internet Computer Protocol).

Our mission is to make it easy for developers to create decentralized applications that are tamperproof, fast, and incorporate privacy innovations capable of scaling to millions of users around the world.
