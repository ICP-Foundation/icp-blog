With only 7 months since Filecoin Mainnet Liftoff, there are now more than 2300 active miners providing hundreds of pebibytes of useful storage on the Filecoin Network every week. However, this amazing growth rate is actually a small fraction of the total capacity Filecoin storage providers are ready to add to the network.

Due to massive demand in providing services on the Filecoin Network, storage growth has been rate-limited by Filecoin chain capacity since well before mainnet launch. Blocks are currently full of new capacity proofs, storage deals, and ongoing storage verification (Window PoSts) - limiting the new storage that miners can commit to Filecoin, and making all other on-chain transactions like publishing storage deals more expensive due to gas fees!
