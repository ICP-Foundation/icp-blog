      <description>With the advent of WebAssembly (home) there has never been a better time to learn Rust on top of your existing JavaScript and Node.js knowledge for high performance computing in the browser, on the server and on the edge.
Adding Rust to your tech stack on top of Node.js is a match made in heaven as Rust provides advanced support for WebAssembly and WebAssembly binary format is runnable in Node.js. With this deep dive, you will get up and running using Rust.</description>

      <description>The Internet Computer is a completely novel public blockchain that can run at web speed and scale without bounds.
Just like the internet is created by the IP protocol, the Internet Computer is created by a decentralized protocol (ICP) that weaves together the compute capacity of node machines running at independent data centers across the globe. By simply adding more node machines, the capacity of the Internet Computer blockchain can scale infinitely.</description>
